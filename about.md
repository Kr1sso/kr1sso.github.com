**Hello** --- I'm Kristijan &#138;imi&#263;, a developer in love with Apple technologies, currently based in Berlin, Germany. I'm was working with the lovely folks from [6Wunderkinder](http://www.6wunderkinder.com) creating **Wunderlist** for [**Mac**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist-to-do-task-list/id410628904?mt=12) and [**iOS**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist-to-do-task-list/id406644151?mt=8) and now put my skills to use at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) to help create the next-generation of task services. 

Besides being a beatifully designed task management app with over *6 million* users and a joy to use, Wunderlist also got the *'App of the Year 2013'* award on the Mac App Store, which I'm unbelievably thankful for.

Because I'm really bad at remembering certain things, this blog is all about having a backlog. What you will find here, is probably:

* *Thoughts* about things that matter to me in life.
* Things I've learnt and stumbled over in my day to day work with *Objective-C*.
* *Updates* about small projects I'm working on.
* *Links* to other sites containing stuff you shouldn't miss.

When I'm not coding or trying to write meaningful sentences in English, I'm exploring Berlin with my beautiful wife Edita. I want to use this spot right here to thank her for putting up with my countless hours of zombie-like starring at the screen and all my other bad habbits --- *I love you!*
